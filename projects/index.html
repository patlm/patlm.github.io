      <p>
        I am currently working on adding the projects I have worked on below.  For now, however, feel free to check out my resume or <a href="https://github.com/patlm">github</a> to see my main projects.

        <dd>
          Cashister is an iPad cash register application I created after recognizing the challenges of working in a high school concession stand.  The application allows workers to more efficiently fulfill larger orders by providing a list of items ordered and calculating the order's total cost.  The application is currently available on the iPad App Store.

        <dd>
          Class-Learn is an open source learning platform I have slowly been working on.  The focus of the project is to create a learning platform optimized for both the student and teacher through providing customization of how courses are set up.  So far, however, I have only worked on setting up authentication and permissions for users.

        <dt><a href="https://github.com/patlm/CornhacksExtremeTicTacToe" target="_blank">Extreme Tic Tac Toe</a></dt>
        <dd>
          For the CornHacks 2019 hackathon, my team created the game of Extreme Tic Tac Toe (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_tic-tac-toe" target="_blank>">Ultamite Tic Tac Toe</a>) using Java.  While the game may have some bugs, it was a great learning experience of how to effectively work on one project with multiple people.  Additionally, at the hackathon, we were able to gain experience utilizing pair programming.
