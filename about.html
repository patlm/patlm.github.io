      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p id="aboutParagraph">
        Hi, my name is Patrick Murphy.  I grew up in rural Nebraska where I developed a passion for technology.  I am now studying software engineering and pursuing this passion at the University of Nebraska-Lincolnâ€™s Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management.  While not studying for classes, I am involved with intramural sports, Raikes School Ambassadors, and the UNL Robotics Club.  This past year, for the robotics club, I served as the Engineering Student Advisory Board representative.  Outside of computer science, my hobbies include photography and basketball.
